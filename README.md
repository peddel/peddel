ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Pedro!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a student specializing in Advanced Embedded Systems Development. I enjoy solving complex problems and creating efficient solutions using C, C++, and Python. I'm passionate about embedded systems, IoT, and low-level programming. Hereâ€™s a bit more about me:

ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

	Languages: C, C++, Python
	Embedded Platforms: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, FRDM-K64F, ESP32
	Tools: Git, Visual Studio Code, CMake
	Protocols: I2C, SPI, UART, CAN
	Operating Systems: Linux, FreeRTOS, RTEMS


ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Currently Working On:

Iâ€™m developing the communication node of an automated greenhouse control system that monitors and manages key environmental factors like temperature, humidity, light, and soil moisture. Using sensors, actuators, and a Human-Machine Interface (HMI), the system maintains optimal conditions for plant growth while enabling real-time monitoring and control via an ESP32, MQTT, and an SD card for data logging. The project integrates features like remote access, NTP-	based time synchronization, and configurable alerts to ensure a fully automated and efficient greenhouse environment.
